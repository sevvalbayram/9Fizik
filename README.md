# Nutella Cookies Recipe
**Hi! Today i am going to tell you how to make super easy 3 ingredient nutella cookies:)**
## Ingredients:
+ *1 cup Flour*
+ *1 cup Nutella*
+ *1 Egg*


These cookies really are as simple as 1,2,3. Just mix up the dough, roll into balls and bake. I love these cookies on their own but you can add any kind of chocolate chips or nuts you like. The combinations are endless!

### How to make Nutella Cookies? 

1. First, heat the oven to 180°C, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Then, add the Nutella, flour, and egg to a large bowl. Mix until well combined.

3. Using your hands roll about 2 tablespoons of dough into balls.

4. Place cookies on your baking sheet and flatten them with your fingertips.

5. Bake for 8-10 minutes, until they are cooked around the edges and still slightly soft in the middle. Let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then cool on a baking rack.
